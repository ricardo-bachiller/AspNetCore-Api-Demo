# ASP.NET Core 2.2 RESTful Web API Demo

This sample multi-tier application demonstrates common RESTful skeleton of code based on the most popular Microsoft technologies at this moment. ASP.NET Core is a perfect choice and - it Rocks!

Apps developed using this framework can run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It ensures a better reach for your app and faster speed to market.

With ASP.NET Core, dependency injection is built-in. No more reliance on third-party frameworks such as AutoFacor and Ninject.

It's worth a mention, that building and maintaining test app infrastructure is painful and nobody wants to spend too much time on. ASP.NET Core offers a package in <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing" target="_blank">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing</a> that allows our projects to quickly realize many of the benefits end to end tests without the typical costs associated with setting them up. **Includes also Sqlite Health Check End-Point.**
